## Moni-Key Program

To install simply use "pip install pynput". (pynput package)

A keylogger program that allows users to control and monitor input devices. Typically the keyboard is monitored, but you have the option as well to monitor a mouse or trackpad. In this program, I was able to build a keylogger that will allow a log file to be created once program is escaped. Although the options are able to monitor other input devices, I focused only on the keyboard monitoring. Enjoy.
